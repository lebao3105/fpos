## Build tools for FPOS

All binaries here are for Windows (.exe). If you want to taste the full instructions of building this OS, or you're using *NIX, install all dependencies below:

* Free Pascal Compiler (of course)

* Make (might come with FPC if on Windows)

* CDRTools (for mkisofs) (should consider xorriso with mkisofs mode, this CDRTools seems not to have any new pre-built releases = build from source manually)

* Netwide Assembler (nasm)

For the best management and installations, you can consider using Cigwin or MSYS2 if on Windows.
